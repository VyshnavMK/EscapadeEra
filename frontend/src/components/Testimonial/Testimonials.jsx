          "It’s really nice to have a platform like GAFFL with lots of travelers
          wanting to do the same as you, a real beautiful cultural exchange. You
          can meet people so easily and in a trustful way. We were four girls,
          from French, German and American backgrounds, without knowing each
          other from before. We spent an amazing week together, 2000km driving,
          camping on the way. We saw kangaroos, koalas, penguins and pelicans"

          common. Couldn't have done it without EE helping us find one another!
          It has honestly made NZ so much cheaper to explore as I get to split
          the costs with someone too​"
